### Final Diagnosis:

- **Panic Disorder and Anxiety-Related Issues:**
  - The symptoms described in both the cardiologist and psychologist reports, such as sudden chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, and feelings of impending doom, are consistent with panic attacks and anxiety disorders. The history of anxiety and the high-stress job further support this as a primary issue.

- **GERD and Associated Respiratory Symptoms:**
  - The cardiologist and pulmonologist reports suggest GERD as a potential contributor to chest pain and respiratory symptoms. Despite current treatment, GERD can mimic cardiac symptoms and may lead to respiratory issues through micro-aspiration or vagal reflexes.

- **Autonomic Nervous System Dysregulation:**
  - The neurologist report highlights the possibility of autonomic nervous system dysregulation, which can manifest with symptoms similar to those experienced by the patient and is often associated with anxiety disorders. This could explain the combination of cardiac-like, respiratory, and neurological symptoms.
